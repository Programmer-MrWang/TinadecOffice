/// <summary>
/// The product-wide error contract carried by every problem response.
///
/// A status code and a message tell a reader that something failed; they do not say whether
/// retrying helps, whether the person can fix it, or which control to touch. Every failure the
/// API reports is therefore classified on two axes — who can resolve it, and whether repeating
/// the request could succeed — and may name the recovery actions a client can offer.
///
/// Categories are a closed set so a client can branch on them without tracking individual codes:
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><c>user_action_required</c> — a person can resolve it (edit configuration, pick a
/// folder, sign in). Retrying the identical request will fail the same way.</item>
/// <item><c>retryable</c> — the same request may succeed later (a lease is held, a peer is
/// busy, a transient conflict).</item>
/// <item><c>environment_unavailable</c> — a dependency this machine needs is missing or
/// unreachable (a registered folder was deleted, a tool is not installed, the backend is
/// down). A person usually resolves it outside the failing request.</item>
/// <item><c>internal</c> — an unexpected defect. Always reportable, never user-fixable.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// Actions are stable identifiers, not sentences: the client owns the wording and the
/// behaviour, so a localized UI never depends on a server-side translation.
